% bisectionMethod function Inputs:
% yourFunction: an equation you would like to test
% xLower: a lower guess of what the midpoint might be
% xUpper: a higher guess of what the midpoint might be
% errorTolerance: how close you would like the answer to be
% maxIteration: the max number of times this should loop
 
function x = bisectionMethod(yourFunction, xLower, xUpper, errorTolerance, maxIteration)

% if only 3 inputs are called sets the default iterations to 10
if nargin == 4
    maxIteration = 10;
end

% initiallizes several variables to be used later

% creates a while loop to continue calculating until the errorTolerance % is reached or it has done the maxIterations
while percentError > errorTolerance && i < maxIteration
